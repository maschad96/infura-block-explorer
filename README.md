# Running the project locally

1. You might need to have typescript installed globally, though you shouldn't since it's a devDependency of this project
2. `git clone https://github.com/maschad96/infura-block-explorer`
3. `cd infura-block-explorer/client`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run start`

**Next steps for the project:
**

1. Calculate Average Block Height
2. Calculate Average Block Fullness
3. Improve the popover experience and add links to Etherscan addresses in the popover
4. Maybe add a separate layout for block-specific data, with more detail on the block in a table view.
